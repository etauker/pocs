# NgxShowcase

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.

## Development server

Run `npx ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To also work inside one of the libraries (e.g. timelanes), also enable dynamic compilation by running `npx ng build --project timelanes --watch` from the directory where this file is located.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

To generate a new component inside a library, run `npx ng g c <component-name> --project <lib-name>`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
